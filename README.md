Hello, I am Raj Gupta 
My Code is 2025AJPS0867H 
This git is for Avionics Induction of TEAM JANUS

Here I am explaining my code

#Task -1 
In this task, we have to make a live graph of Velocity vs Time and Height vs Time.

Firstly, we were only given the Pressure Data, so what I did was I applied the formula for Height p = p* + &gh ( here & is Density of Air ),
Then, simply by applying the basic formula, we got the Height data. I used this formula in Excel within 5 minutes. I was done with my Data Part,
then I used MATPLOTLIB for my Graph Part

#Task -2 
In this task, we have to use a Force Sensor, and then the Light should blink on a Different Event.

Firstly, I applied a force sensor in A0 to get the data, then by basic IF/ELSE I solved my Task
